[{"Name": "How Not to Die: Discover the Foods Scientifically Proven to Prevent and Reverse Disease", "Description": "From the physician behind the wildly popular website NutritionFacts.org, <i>How Not to Die </i>reveals the groundbreaking scientific evidence behind the only diet that can prevent and reverse many of the causes of disease-related death.<br /><br />The vast majority of premature deaths can be prevented through simple changes in diet and lifestyle. In <i>How Not to Die</i>, Dr. Michael Greger, the internationally-renowned nutrition expert, physician, and founder of NutritionFacts.org, examines the fifteen top causes of premature death in America -- heart disease, various cancers, diabetes, Parkinson's, high blood pressure, and more -- and explains how nutritional and lifestyle interventions can sometimes trump prescription pills and other pharmaceutical and surgical approaches, freeing us to live healthier lives.<br /><br />The simple truth is that most doctors are good at treating acute illnesses but bad at preventing chronic disease. The fifteen leading causes of death claim the lives of 1.6 million Americans annually. This doesn't have to be the case. By following Dr. Greger's advice, all of it backed up by strong scientific evidence, you will learn which foods to eat and which lifestyle changes to make to live longer.<br /><br />History of prostate cancer in your family? Put down that glass of milk and add flaxseed to your diet whenever you can. Have high blood pressure? Hibiscus tea can work better than a leading hypertensive drug-and without the side effects. Fighting off liver disease? Drinking coffee can reduce liver inflammation. Battling breast cancer? Consuming soy is associated with prolonged survival. Worried about heart disease (the number 1 killer in the United States)? Switch to a whole-food, plant-based diet, which has been repeatedly shown not just to prevent the disease but often stop it in its tracks.<br /><br />In addition to showing what to eat to help treat the top fifteen causes of death, <i>How Not to Die</i> includes Dr. Greger's Daily Dozen -- a checklist of the twelve foods we should consume every day. Full of practical, actionable advice and surprising, cutting edge nutritional science, these doctor's orders are just what we need to live longer, healthier lives.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1436292289l/25663961.jpg"}], "Authors": "Michael Greger, Gene  Stone", "Category": "Health", "Rating": "4.53", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25663961-how-not-to-die", "Pages": "576", "Year": "2015", "Rating_Dist": "5:7622|4:2762|3:835|2:200|1:88|total:11507", "Ratings_Count": "8856", "Text_Reviews_Count": "1136"}, {"Name": "Overcoming Gravity: A Systematic Approach to Gymnastics and Bodyweight Strength", "Description": null, "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1481227153l/33293328.jpg"}], "Authors": "Steven Low", "Category": "Health", "Rating": "4.32", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33293328-overcoming-gravity", "Pages": "598", "Year": "2016", "Rating_Dist": "5:263|4:152|3:60|2:17|1:4|total:496", "Ratings_Count": "48", "Text_Reviews_Count": "5"}, {"Name": "Convict Conditioning: How to Bust Free of All Weakness Using the Lost Secrets of Supreme Survival Strength", "Description": "How to Train As If Your VERY LIFE Depended on Your Degree of REAL Strength, Power and ToughnessMost physical training systems are designed for the domesticated human animal. That is to say, for us humans who live lives of such relative security that we cultivate our strength and power more out of pride and for a sense of accomplishment than out of an absolute need to survive in the wild. The professional athlete hones his body to function well in a sports event-rather than to emerge safe from a life-or-death struggle. And even those in our military and LEO rely more on the security of their weapons and armor than on their own personal, raw power and brute strength to carry the day. There remains one environment where exuding the necessary degree of authoritative strength and power can mean the difference between life or death: the maximum security prison. In maximum security, the predator preys on the weak like we breathe air. Intimidation is the daily currency. You either become a professional victim or you develop that supreme survival strength that signals the predator to stay at bay.Paul Wade spent 19 years in hell holes like San Quentin, Angola and Marion. He entered this world a gangly, terrorized weakling and he graduated to final freedom, pound-for-pound one of the strongest humans on the planet.

The authors of this book do; and in doing so, they provoke the reader to consider style, not as an elegant accessory of effective prose, but as its very heart. At a time when writing skills have virtually disappeared, what can be done? If only people learned the principles of verbal correctness, the essential rules, wouldn't good prose simply fall into place? Thomas and Turner say no. Attending to rules of grammar, sense, and sentence structure will no more lead to effective prose than knowing the mechanics of a golf swing will lead to a hole-in-one. Furthermore, ten-step programs to better writing exacerbate the problem by failing to recognize, as Thomas and Turner point out, that there are many styles with different standards. In the first half of Clear and Simple, the authors introduce a range of styles - reflexive, practical, plain, contemplative, romantic, prophetic, and others - contrasting them to classic style. Its principles are simple: The writer adopts the pose that the motive is truth, the purpose is presentation, the reader is an intellectual equal, and the occasion is informal. Classic style is at home in everything from business memos to personal letters, from magazine articles to university writing. The second half of the book is a tour of examples - the exquisite and the execrable - showing what has worked and what hasn't. Classic prose is found everywhere: from Thomas Jefferson to Junichiro Tanizaki, from Mark Twain to the observations of an undergraduate.

He replaces dogma about usage with reason and evidence, allowing writers and editors to apply the guidelines judiciously, rather than robotically, being mindful of what they are designed to accomplish.<br /><br /> Filled with examples of great and gruesome prose, Pinker shows us how the art of writing can be a form of pleasurable mastery and a fascinating intellectual topic in its own right. <br />", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1396671354l/20821371.jpg"}], "Authors": "Steven Pinker", "Category": "Writing", "Rating": "4.06", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/20821371-the-sense-of-style", "Pages": "368", "Year": "2014", "Rating_Dist": "5:1861|4:2131|3:971|2:182|1:75|total:5220", "Ratings_Count": "4060", "Text_Reviews_Count": "545"}, {"Name": "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality", "Description": "Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality is a work of alternate-universe Harry Potter fan-fiction wherein Petunia Evans has married an Oxford biochemistry professor and young genius Harry grows up fascinated by science and science fiction.

What is the similarity between a human rib cage and an airplane or a bison and a cantilevered bridge? How might we plan for things to improve as they are used instead of wearing out? The author has chosen eight criteria that constitute the major influences on three-dimensional form. These criteria comprise the eight chapters of the book: each looks at form from entirely different viewpoints. The products of both nature and man are examined and compared. This book will make readers-especially those who design and build-aware of their physical environment and how to break away from previously held assumptions and indifference about the ways forms in our human environment have evolved. It shows better ways to do things.The author's practical, no-nonsense approach and his exquisite drawings, done especially for this volume, provide a clear understanding of what can and cannot be; how big or small an object should be, of what material it will be made, how its function will relate to its design, how its use will change it, and what laws will influence its development. The facts and information were gathered from many sources: the areas of mechanics, structure, and materials; geology, biology, anthropology, paleobiology, morphology and others.

Suppose, instead of thinking about organisms using genes to reproduce themselves, as we had since Mendel's work was rediscovered, we turn it around and imagine that \"our\" genes build and maintain us in order to make more genes. That simple reversal seems to answer many puzzlers which had stumped scientists for years, and we haven't thought of evolution in the same way since.<br /><br />Why are there miles and miles of \"unused\" DNA within each of our bodies? Why should a bee give up its own chance to reproduce to help raise her sisters and brothers? With a prophet's clarity, Dawkins told us the answers from the perspective of molecules competing for limited space and resources to produce more of their own kind. Drawing fascinating examples from every field of biology, he paved the way for a serious re-evaluation of evolution.

Drawing on the latest discoveries, and developing complex scientific ideas and relating them to real life through many fascinating case studies and anecdotes, the author explores how the brain engages in complex decision-making; how it deals with novelty and ambiguity; and how it addresses moral choices. At every step, Goldberg challenges entrenched assumptions. For example, we know that the left hemisphere of the brain is the seat of language--but Goldberg argues that language may not be the central adaptation of the left hemisphere. Apes lack language, yet many also show evidence of asymmetric hemispheric development. Goldberg also finds that a complex interaction between the frontal lobes and the amygdale--between a recently evolved and a much older part of the brain--controls emotion, as conscious thoughts meet automatic impulses. The author illustrates this observation with a personal example: the difficulty he experienced when trying to pick up a baby alligator he knew to be harmless, as his amygdala battled his effort to extend his hand.<br /> In the years since the original <em>Executive Brain</em>, Goldberg has remained at the front of his field, constantly challenging orthodoxy.

He discusses the limitations of computers, physics, logic, and our own thought processes.<br /><br />Yanofsky describes simple tasks that would take computers trillions of centuries to complete and other problems that computers can never solve; perfectly formed English sentences that make no sense; different levels of infinity; the bizarre world of the quantum; the relevance of relativity theory; the causes of chaos theory; math problems that cannot be solved by normal means; and statements that are true but cannot be proven. He explains the limitations of our intuitions about the world -- our ideas about space, time, and motion, and the complex relationship between the knower and the known.<br /><br />Moving from the concrete to the abstract, from problems of everyday language to straightforward philosophical questions to the formalities of physics and mathematics, Yanofsky demonstrates a myriad of unsolvable problems and paradoxes. Exploring the various limitations of our knowledge, he shows that many of these limitations have a similar pattern and that by investigating these patterns, we can better understand the structure and limitations of reason itself. Yanofsky even attempts to look beyond the borders of reason to see what, if anything, is out there.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1381287623l/17841838.jpg"}], "Authors": "Noson S.

Filled with fresh ideas and insights, this book is one of the most engaging and controversial visions of the future ever written by a serious scholar.<br /><br />Hans Moravec convincingly argues that we are approaching a watershed in the history of life--a time when the boundaries between biological and postbiological intelligence will begin to dissolve. Within forty years, Moravec believes, we will achieve human equivalence in our machines, not only in their capacity to reason but also in their ability to perceive, interact with, and change their complex environment. The critical factor is mobility. A computer rooted to one place is doomed to static iterations, whereas a machine on the prowl, like a mobile organism, must evolve a richer fund of knowledge about an ever-changing world upon which to base its actions.<br /><br />In order to achieve anything near human equivalence, robots will need, at the least, the capacity to perform ten trillion calculations per second. Given the trillion-fold increase in computational power since the end of the nineteenth century, and the promise of exotic technologies far surpassing the now-familiar lasers and even superconductors, Moravec concludes that our hardware will have no trouble meeting this forty-year timetable.<br /><br />But human equivalence is just the beginning, not an upper bound. Once the tireless thinking capacity of robots is directed to the problem of their own improvement and reproduction, even the sky will not limit their voracious exploration of the universe. In the concluding chapters Moravec challenges us to imagine with him the possibilities and pitfalls of such a scenario. Rather than warning us of takeover by robots, the author invites us, as we approach the end of this millennium, to speculate about a plausible, wonderful postbiological future and the ways in which our minds might participate in its unfolding.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Hans Moravec", "Category": "Science and Medicine", "Rating": "3.98", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/648195.Mind_Children", "Pages": "224", "Year": "1990", "Rating_Dist": "5:34|4:40|3:25|2:4|1:1|total:104", "Ratings_Count": "102", "Text_Reviews_Count": "8"}, {"Name": "How to Find a Habitable Planet", "Description": "Ever since Carl Sagan first predicted that extraterrestrial civilizations must number in the millions, the search for life on other planets has gripped our imagination. Is Earth so rare that advanced life forms like us--or even the simplest biological organisms--are unique to the universe? <i>How to Find a Habitable Planet</i> describes how scientists are testing Sagan's prediction, and demonstrates why Earth may not be so rare after all.<br /><br />James Kasting has worked closely with NASA in its mission to detect habitable worlds outside our solar system, and in this book he introduces readers to the advanced methodologies being used in this extraordinary quest. He addresses the compelling questions that planetary scientists grapple with today: What exactly makes a planet habitable? What are the signatures of life astronomers should look for when they scan the heavens for habitable worlds? In providing answers, Kasting explains why Earth has remained habitable despite a substantial rise in solar luminosity over time, and why our neighbors, Venus and Mars, haven't. If other Earth-sized planets endowed with enough water and carbon are out there, he argues, chances are good that some of those planets sustain life. Kasting describes the efforts under way to find them, and predicts that future discoveries will profoundly alter our view of the universe and our place in it.<br /><br />This book is a must-read for anyone who has ever dreamed of finding other planets like ours--and perhaps even life like ours--in the cosmos.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1267381506l/7551498.jpg"}], "Authors": "James F.

With stories that entertain as much as they inform, Wilson outlines the basic principles of evolution and shows how, properly understood, they can illuminate the length and breadth of creation, from the origin of life to the nature of religion. Now everyone can move beyond the sterile debates about creationism and intelligent design to share Darwin\u2019s panoramic view of animal and human life, seamlessly connected to each other.<br /><br />Evolution, as Wilson explains, is not just about dinosaurs and human origins, but about why all species behave as they do\u2014from beetles that devour their own young, to bees that function as a collective brain, to dogs that are smarter in some respects than our closest ape relatives. And basic evolutionary principles are also the foundation for humanity\u2019s capacity for symbolic thought, culture, and morality.<br /><br />In example after example, Wilson sheds new light on Darwin\u2019s grand theory and how it can be applied to daily life.

These and many other questions are brilliantly illuminated in <em>The Origins of Genius</em>.<br /> Dean Simonton convincingly argues that creativity can best be understood as a Darwinian process of variation and selection. The artist or scientist generates a wealth of ideas, and then subjects these ideas to aesthetic or scientific judgment, selecting only those that have the best chance to survive and reproduce. Indeed, the true test of genius is the ability to bequeath an impressive and influential body of work to future generations. Simonton draws on the latest research into creativity and explores such topics as the personality type of the genius, whether genius is genetic or produced by environment and education, the links between genius and mental illness (Darwin himself was emotionally and mentally unwell), the high incidence of childhood trauma, especially loss of a parent, amongst Nobel Prize winners, the importance of unconscious incubation in creative problem-solving, and much more. Simonton substantiates his theory by examining and quoting from the work of such eminent figures as Henri Poincare, W. H.

Instead of yet another \"method,\" Guskin offers a strategy based on a radically simple and refreshing idea: that the actor's work is not to \"create a character\" but rather to be continually, personally responsive to the text, wherever his impulse takes him, from first read-through to final performance. From this credo derives an entirely new perspective on auditioning and the challenge of developing a role and keeping it fresh, even over hundreds of performances. Drawing on examples from his clients' work and his own, Guskin presents acting as a constantly evolving exploration rather than as a progression toward a fixed goal.

From Pedro we understand the kind of patience necessary to rescue someone from the darkness. In each chapter we benefit from Boyle\u2019s wonderful, hard-earned wisdom.

In search of an answer, Christopher McDougall sets off to find a tribe of the world\u2019s greatest distance runners and learn their secrets, and in the process shows us that everything we thought we knew about running is wrong.<br /><br />Isolated by the most savage terrain in North America, the reclusive Tarahumara Indians of Mexico\u2019s deadly Copper Canyons are custodians of a lost art. For centuries they have practiced techniques that allow them to run hundreds of miles without rest and chase down anything from a deer to an Olympic marathoner while enjoying every mile of it. Their superhuman talent is matched by uncanny health and serenity, leaving the Tarahumara immune to the diseases and strife that plague modern existence. With the help of Caballo Blanco, a mysterious loner who lives among the tribe, the author was able not only to uncover the secrets of the Tarahumara but also to find his own inner ultra-athlete, as he trained for the challenge of a lifetime: a fifty-mile race through the heart of Tarahumara country pitting the tribe against an odd band of Americans, including a star ultramarathoner, a beautiful young surfer, and a barefoot wonder.<br /><br />With a sharp wit and wild exuberance, McDougall takes us from the high-tech science labs at Harvard to the sun-baked valleys and freezing peaks across North America, where ever-growing numbers of ultrarunners are pushing their bodies to the limit, and, finally, to the climactic race in the Copper Canyons. Born to Run is that rare book that will not only engage your mind but inspire your body when you realize that the secret to happiness is right at your feet, and that you, indeed all of us, were born to run.<br /><br />Source: chrismcdougall.com", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1320531983l/6289283.jpg"}], "Authors": "Christopher McDougall", "Category": "Philosophy And Psychology", "Rating": "4.28", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/6289283-born-to-run", "Pages": "287", "Year": "2009", "Rating_Dist": "5:69474|4:48591|3:17014|2:3656|1:1821|total:140556", "Ratings_Count": "124971", "Text_Reviews_Count": "11378"}, {"Name": "Prometheus Rising", "Description": "Imagine trying to make sense of an amalgam of Timothy Leary's eight neurological circuits, G.I.

Kandel, <i>The Age of Insight</i> takes us to Vienna 1900, where leaders in science, medicine, and art began a revolution that changed forever how we think about the human mind\u2014our conscious and unconscious thoughts and emotions\u2014and how mind and brain relate to art. <br /> \u00a0<br /> At the turn of the century, Vienna was the cultural capital of Europe. Artists and scientists met in glittering salons, where they freely exchanged ideas that led to revolutionary breakthroughs in psychology, brain science, literature, and art. Kandel takes us into the world of Vienna to trace, in rich and rewarding detail, the ideas and advances made then, and their enduring influence today.<br /> \u00a0<br /> The Vienna School of Medicine led the way with its realization that truth lies hidden beneath the surface. That principle infused Viennese culture and strongly influenced the other pioneers of Vienna 1900. Sigmund Freud shocked the world with his insights into how our everyday unconscious aggressive and erotic desires are repressed and disguised in symbols, dreams, and behavior. Arthur Schnitzler revealed women\u2019s unconscious sexuality in his novels through his innovative use of the interior monologue. Gustav Klimt, Oscar Kokoschka, and Egon Schiele created startlingly evocative and honest portraits that expressed unconscious lust, desire, anxiety, and the fear of death.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Kandel tells the story of how these pioneers\u2014Freud, Schnitzler, Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele\u2014inspired by the Vienna School of Medicine, in turn influenced the founders of the Vienna School of Art History to ask pivotal questions such as What does the viewer bring to a work of art? How does the beholder respond to it? These questions prompted new and ongoing discoveries in psychology and brain biology, leading to revelations about how we see and perceive, how we think and feel, and how we respond to and create works of art. Kandel, one of the leading scientific thinkers of our time, places these five innovators in the context of today\u2019s cutting-edge science and gives us a new understanding of the modernist art of Klimt, Kokoschka, and Schiele, as well as the school of thought of Freud and Schnitzler. Reinvigorating the intellectual enquiry that began in Vienna 1900, <i>The Age of Insight</i> is a wonderfully written, superbly researched, and beautifully illustrated book that also provides a foundation for future work in neuroscience and the humanities. It is an extraordinary book from an international leader in neuroscience and intellectual history.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1333579851l/12263681.jpg"}], "Authors": "Eric R.

He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: the Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits), the Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and the Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.<br /><br />Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and pertinent facts from science and history. Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.<br /><br />Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense, far from being dangerous, can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers. All this is done in the style that earned his previous books many prizes and worldwide acclaim: wit, lucidity, and insight into matters great and small.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Steven Pinker", "Category": "Philosophy And Psychology", "Rating": "4.08", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5752.The_Blank_Slate", "Pages": "528", "Year": "2003", "Rating_Dist": "5:7719|4:6461|3:3043|2:907|1:464|total:18594", "Ratings_Count": "17529", "Text_Reviews_Count": "667"}, {"Name": "The Gifts of Imperfection: Let Go of Who You Think You're Supposed to Be and Embrace Who You Are", "Description": "New York Times best-selling author and professor Bren\u00e9 Brown offers a powerful and inspiring book that explores how to cultivate the courage, compassion, and connection to embrace your imperfections and to recognize that you are enough.<br /><br />Each day we face a barrage of images and messages from society and the media telling us who, what, and how we should be.

We consistently overpay, underestimate, and procrastinate. We fail to understand the profound effects of our emotions on what we want, and we overvalue what we already own. Yet these misguided behaviors are neither random nor senseless. They're systematic and predictable--making us \"predictably\" irrational.<br /><br />From drinking coffee to losing weight, from buying a car to choosing a romantic partner, Ariely explains how to break through these systematic patterns of thought to make better decisions. \"Predictably Irrational\" will change the way we interact with the world--one small decision at a time.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Dan Ariely", "Category": "Philosophy And Psychology", "Rating": "4.11", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1713426.Predictably_Irrational", "Pages": "400", "Year": "2008", "Rating_Dist": "5:31854|4:32667|3:13280|2:2877|1:1180|total:81858", "Ratings_Count": "72877", "Text_Reviews_Count": "3601"}, {"Name": "Flow: The Psychology of Optimal Experience", "Description": "Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi's famous investigations of \"optimal experience\" have revealed that what makes an experience genuinely satisfying is a state of consciousness called <i>flow</i>.

He shows how many intellectuals have denied the existence of human nature by embracing three linked dogmas: the Blank Slate (the mind has no innate traits), the Noble Savage (people are born good and corrupted by society), and the Ghost in the Machine (each of us has a soul that makes choices free from biology). Each dogma carries a moral burden, so their defenders have engaged in desperate tactics to discredit the scientists who are now challenging them.<br /><br />Pinker injects calm and rationality into these debates by showing that equality, progress, responsibility, and purpose have nothing to fear from discoveries about a rich human nature. He disarms even the most menacing threats with clear thinking, common sense, and pertinent facts from science and history. Despite its popularity among intellectuals during much of the twentieth century, he argues, the doctrine of the Blank Slate may have done more harm than good. It denies our common humanity and our individual preferences, replaces hardheaded analyses of social problems with feel-good slogans, and distorts our understanding of government, violence, parenting, and the arts.<br /><br />Pinker shows that an acknowledgement of human nature that is grounded in science and common sense, far from being dangerous, can complement insights about the human condition made by millennia of artists and philosophers.

But modern times have forced the world\u2019s tribes into a shared space, resulting in epic clashes of values along with unprecedented opportunities. As the world shrinks, the moral lines that divide us become more salient and more puzzling. We fight over everything from tax codes to gay marriage to global warming, and we wonder where, if at all, we can find our common ground.<br /><br /> A grand synthesis of neuroscience, psychology, and philosophy, <i>Moral Tribes</i> reveals the underlying causes of modern conflict and lights the way forward. Greene compares the human brain to a dual-mode camera, with point-and-shoot automatic settings (\u201cportrait,\u201d \u201clandscape\u201d) as well as a manual mode. Our point-and-shoot settings are our emotions\u2014efficient, automated programs honed by evolution, culture, and personal experience. The brain\u2019s manual mode is its capacity for deliberate reasoning, which makes our thinking flexible. Point-and-shoot emotions make us social animals, turning Me into Us. But they also make us tribal animals, turning Us against Them. Our tribal emotions make us fight\u2014sometimes with bombs, sometimes with words\u2014often with life-and-death stakes.<br /><br /> An award-winning teacher and scientist, Greene directs Harvard University\u2019s Moral Cognition Lab, which uses cutting-edge neuroscience and cognitive techniques to understand how people really make moral decisions. Combining insights from the lab with lessons from decades of social science and centuries of philosophy, the great question of <i>Moral Tribes </i>is this: How can we get along with Them when what they want feels so wrong to Us?<br /><br /> Ultimately, Greene offers a set of maxims for navigating the modern moral terrain, a practical road map for solving problems and living better lives. <i>Moral Tribes</i> shows us when to trust our instincts, when to reason, and how the right kind of reasoning can move us forward.

But increasingly, psychologists, educators, and others have come to challenge this premise. \"Outsmarting IQ\" reveals how earlier discoveries about IQ, together with recent research, show that intelligence is not genetically fixed. Intelligence can be taught. David Perkins, renowned for his research on thinking, learning, and education, identifies three distinct kinds of intelligence: the fixed neurological intelligence linked to IQ tests; the specialized knowledge and experience that individuals acquire over time; and reflective intelligence, the ability to become aware of one's mental habits and transcend limited patterns of thinking. Although all of these forms of intelligence function simultaneously, it is reflective intelligence, Perkins shows, that affords the best opportunity to amplify human intellect. This is the kind of intelligence that helps us to make wise personal decisions, solve challenging technical problems, find creative ideas, and learn complex topics in mathematics, the sciences, management, and other areas. It is the kind of intelligence most needed in an increasingly competitive and complicated world.<br /><br />Using his own pathbreaking research at Harvard and a rich array of other sources, Perkins paints a compelling picture of the skills and attitudes underlying learnable intelligence. He identifies typical pitfalls in multiple perspectives, and neglecting evidence. He reveals the underlying mechanisms of intelligent behavior. And he explores new frontiers in the development of intelligence in education, business, and other settings.<br /><br />This book will beof interest to people who have a personal or professional stake in increasing their intellectual skills, to those who look toward better education and a more thoughtful society, and not least to those who follow today's heated debates about the nature of intelligence.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "David N.

Baumeister, teams with <i>New York Times</i> science writer John Tierney to reveal the secrets of self-control and how to master it. </b>In <i>Willpower</i>, the pioneering researcher Roy F. Baumeister collaborates with renowned <i>New York Times</i> science writer John Tierney to revolutionize our understanding of the most coveted human virtue: self-control.<br /><br />In what became one of the most cited papers in social science literature, Baumeister discovered that willpower actually operates like a muscle: it can be strengthened with practice and fatigued by overuse. Willpower is fueled by glucose, and it can be bolstered simply by replenishing the brain's store of fuel. That's why eating and sleeping- and especially failing to do either of those-have such dramatic effects on self-control (and why dieters have such a hard time resisting temptation).<br /><br />Baumeister's latest research shows that we typically spend four hours every day resisting temptation. No wonder people around the world rank a lack of self-control as their biggest weakness. <i>Willpower</i> looks to the lives of entrepreneurs, parents, entertainers, and artists-including David Blaine, Eric Clapton, and others-who have flourished by improving their self-control.<br /><br />The lessons from their stories and psychologists' experiments can help anyone. You learn not only how to build willpower but also how to conserve it for crucial moments by setting the right goals and using the best new techniques for monitoring your progress. Once you master these techniques and establish the right habits, willpower gets easier: you'll need less conscious mental energy to avoid temptation. That's neither magic nor empty self-help sloganeering, but rather a solid path to a better life.<br /><br />Combining the best of modern social science with practical wisdom, Baumeister and Tierney here share the definitive compendium of modern lessons in willpower. As our society has moved away from the virtues of thrift and self-denial, it often feels helpless because we face more temptations than ever. But we also have more knowledge and better tools for taking control of our lives. However we define happiness-a close- knit family, a satisfying career, financial security-we won't reach it without mastering self-control.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Roy F.

These questions illustrate the so-called \"prisoner's dilemma, \" a social puzzle that we all face every day. Though the answers may seem simple, their profound implications make the prisoner's dilemma one of the great unifying concepts of science, an idea that has influenced leaders across the political spectrum and informed our views of conflicts ranging from the Cuban missile crisis to the Persian Gulf War. Watching players bluff in a poker game inspired John von Neumann--father of the modern computer and one of the sharpest minds of the century--to construct game theory, a mathematical study of conflict and deception. Game theory was readily embraced at the RAND Corporation, the archetypical think tank charged with formulating military strategy for the atomic age, and in 1950 two RAND scientists made a momentous discovery. Called the \"prisoner's dilemma, \" it is a disturbing and mind-bending game where two or more people may betray the common good for individual gain. Introduced shortly after the Soviet Union acquired the atomic bomb, the prisoner's dilemma quickly became a popular allegory of the nuclear arms race. Intellectuals such as von Neumann and Bertrand Russell joined military and political leaders in rallying to the \"preventive war\" movement, which advocated a nuclear first strike against the Soviet Union. Though the Truman administration rejected preventive war the United States entered into an arms race with the Soviets and game theory developed into a controversial tool of public policy--alternately accused of justifying arms races and touted as th only hope of preventing them.

Why do we often zero in on the wrong factors when making big decisions, like where to move?\u2014driving us to reconsider what we think we know about attention.<br /><br /> Gallagher looks beyond sound bites on our proliferating BlackBerries and the increased incidence of ADD in children to the discoveries of neuroscience and psychology and the wisdom of home truths, profoundly altering and expanding the contemporary conversation on attention and its power. Science\u2019s major contribution to the study of attention has been the discovery that its basic mechanism is an either/or process of selection.

Even though the glass ceiling is cracked, most women stay comfortably beneath it, and everywhere we hear about vitally important \u201chardwired\u201d differences between male and female brains. The neuroscience we read about in magazines, newspaper articles, books, and sometimes even scientific journals increasingly tells a tale of two brains, and the result is more often than not a validation of the status quo.

Thus, in an elegant anagram (translation = lost in an art), Pulitzer Prize-winning author and pioneering cognitive scientist Douglas Hofstadter hints at what led him to pen a deep personal homage to the witty sixteenth-century French poet Cl\u00e9ment Marot.\u201d<br /><br /><i>Le ton beau de Marot</i>\u201d literally means \u201dThe sweet tone of Marot\u201d, but to a French ear it suggests \u201dLe tombeau de Marot\u201d\u2014that is, \u201dThe tomb of Marot\u201d. That double entendre foreshadows the linguistic exuberance of this book, which was sparked a decade ago when Hofstadter, under the spell of an exquisite French miniature by Marot, got hooked on the challenge of recreating both its sweet message and its tight rhymes in English\u2014jumping through two tough hoops at once. In the next few years, he not only did many of his own translations of Marot's poem, but also enlisted friends, students, colleagues, family, noted poets, and translators\u2014even three state-of-the-art translation programs!\u2014to try their hand at this subtle challenge.<br /><br />The rich harvest is represented here by 88 wildly diverse variations on Marot's little theme. Yet this barely scratches the surface of <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i>, for small groups of these poems alternate with chapters that run all over the map of language and thought.<br /><br />Not merely a set of translations of one poem, <i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is an autobiographical essay, a love letter to the French language, a series of musings on life, loss, and death, a sweet bouquet of stirring poetry\u2014but most of all, it celebrates the limitless creativity fired by a passion for the music of words.<br /><br />Dozens of literary themes and creations are woven into the picture, including Pushkin's <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/27829.Eugene_Onegin\" title=\"Eugene Onegin\" rel=\"nofollow\">Eugene Onegin</a>\n</i>, Dante's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/15645.Inferno\" title=\"Inferno\" rel=\"nofollow\">Inferno</a>,</i> Salinger's <i>\n  <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5107.Catcher_in_the_Rye\" title=\"Catcher in the Rye\" rel=\"nofollow\">Catcher in the Rye</a>\n</i>, <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/55934.Villon_s\" title=\"Villon's\" rel=\"nofollow\">Villon's</a> <i>Ballades,</i> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/5152.Nabokov_s\" title=\"Nabokov\u2019s\" rel=\"nofollow\">Nabokov\u2019s</a> essays, Georges Perec's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3677938.La_Disparition\" title=\"La Disparition\" rel=\"nofollow\">La Disparition</a>,</i> Vikram Seth's <i><a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/3073568.The_Golden_Gate\" title=\"The Golden Gate\" rel=\"nofollow\">The Golden Gate</a>,</i> <a href=\"https://www.goodreads.com/author/show/3341504.Horace_s\" title=\"Horace's\" rel=\"nofollow\">Horace's</a> odes, and more.<br /><br />Rife with stunning form-content interplay, crammed with creative linguistic experiments yet always crystal-clear, this book is meant not only for lovers of literature, but also for people who wish to be brought into contact with current ideas about how creativity works, and who wish to see how today\u2019s computational models of language and thought stack up next to the human mind.<br /><br /><i>Le Ton beau de Marot</i> is a sparkling, personal, and poetic exploration aimed at both the literary and the scientific world, and is sure to provoke great excitement and heated controversy among poets and translators, critics and writers, and those involved in the study of creativity and its elusive wellsprings.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Douglas R.

It yields an extraordinary account of the rise and fall of Purgatory as both a belief and a lucrative institution--as well as a capacious new reading of the power of Hamlet.<br /><br />In the mid-sixteenth century, English authorities abruptly changed the relationship between the living and dead. Declaring that Purgatory was a false \"poem,\" they abolished the institutions and banned the practices that Christians relied on to ease the passage to Heaven for themselves and their dead loved ones. Greenblatt explores the fantastic adventure narratives, ghost stories, pilgrimages, and imagery by which a belief in a grisly \"prison house of souls\" had been shaped and reinforced in the Middle Ages. He probes the psychological benefits as well as the high costs of this belief and of its demolition.<br /><br />With the doctrine of Purgatory and the elaborate practices that grew up around it, the church had provided a powerful method of negotiating with the dead. The Protestant attack on Purgatory destroyed this method for most people in England, but it did not eradicate the longings and fears that Catholic doctrine had for centuries focused and exploited. In his strikingly original interpretation, Greenblatt argues that the human desires to commune with, assist, and be rid of the dead were transformed by Shakespeare--consummate conjurer that he was--into the substance of several of his plays, above all the weirdly powerful Hamlet. Thus, the space of Purgatory became the stage haunted by literature's most famous ghost.<br /><br />This book constitutes an extraordinary feat that could have been accomplished by only Stephen Greenblatt. It is at once a deeply satisfying reading of medieval religion, an innovative interpretation of the apparitions that trouble Shakespeare's tragic heroes, and an exploration of how a culture can be inhabited by its own spectral leftovers.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1412006313l/33179.jpg"}], "Authors": "Stephen Greenblatt", "Category": "Shakespeare", "Rating": "3.95", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33179.Hamlet_in_Purgatory", "Pages": "344", "Year": "2002", "Rating_Dist": "5:79|4:101|3:53|2:15|1:3|total:251", "Ratings_Count": "204", "Text_Reviews_Count": "23"}, {"Name": "The Queen's Gambit", "Description": "Eight year-old orphan Beth Harmon is quiet, sullen, and by all appearances unremarkable.

Mainstream science--as well as religious and cultural institutions--has maintained that men and women evolved in families in which a man's possessions and protection were exchanged for a woman's fertility and fidelity. But this narrative is collapsing. Fewer and fewer couples are getting married, and divorce rates keep climbing as adultery and flagging libido drag down even seemingly solid marriages.<br /><br />How can reality be reconciled with the accepted narrative? It can't be, according to renegade thinkers Christopher Ryan and Cacilda Jeth\u00e1. While debunking almost everything we \"know\" about sex, they offer a bold alternative explanation in this provocative and brilliant book.<br /><br />Ryan and Jeth\u00e1's central contention is that human beings evolved in egalitarian groups that shared food, child care, and, often, sexual partners. Weaving together convergent, frequently overlooked evidence from anthropology, archaeology, primatology, anatomy, and psychosexuality, the authors show how far from human nature monogamy really is. Human beings everywhere and in every era have confronted the same familiar, intimate situations in surprisingly different ways. The authors expose the ancient roots of human sexuality while pointing toward a more optimistic future illuminated by our innate capacities for love, cooperation, and generosity.<br /><br />With intelligence, humor, and wonder, Ryan and Jeth\u00e1 show how our promiscuous past haunts our struggles over monogamy, sexual orientation, and family dynamics. They explore why long-term fidelity can be so difficult for so many; why sexual passion tends to fade even as love deepens; why many middle-aged men risk everything for transient affairs with younger women; why homosexuality persists in the face of standard evolutionary logic; and what the human body reveals about the prehistoric origins of modern sexuality.<br /><br />In the tradition of the best historical and scientific writing, <i>Sex at Dawn</i> unapologetically upends unwarranted assumptions and unfounded conclusions while offering a revolutionary understanding of why we live and love as we do.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1291105594l/7640261.jpg"}], "Authors": "Christopher  Ryan, Cacilda Jeth\u00e1", "Category": "Sexuality", "Rating": "4.03", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7640261-sex-at-dawn", "Pages": "400", "Year": "2010", "Rating_Dist": "5:7161|4:6580|3:3274|2:980|1:478|total:18473", "Ratings_Count": "14924", "Text_Reviews_Count": "1576"}, {"Name": "The Ethical Slut: A Guide to Infinite Sexual Possibilities", "Description": "<b>The essential guide for singles and couples who want to explore polyamory in ways that are ethically and emotionally sustainable.</b><br /><br />For anyone who has ever dreamed of love, sex, and companionship beyond the limits of traditional monogamy, this groundbreaking guide navigates the infinite possibilities that open relationships can offer.

His great-grandfather was beaten to death by the Klu Klux Klan for attempting to vote. His grandfather was prevented from voting by Klan intimidation; his father was barred by poll taxes and literacy tests. Today, Cotton cannot vote because he, like many black men in the United States, has been labeled a felon and is currently on parole.\"<br /><br />As the United States celebrates the nation's \"triumph over race\" with the election of Barack Obama, the majority of young black men in major American cities are locked behind bars or have been labeled felons for life. Although Jim Crow laws have been wiped off the books, an astounding percentage of the African American community remains trapped in a subordinate status--much like their grandparents before them.<br /><br />In this incisive critique, former litigator-turned-legal-scholar Michelle Alexander provocatively argues that we have not ended racial caste in America: we have simply redesigned it. Alexander shows that, by targeting black men and decimating communities of color, the U.S. criminal justice system functions as a contemporary system of racial control, even as it formally adheres to the principle of color blindness.

These intuitions feel like self-evident truths, making us righteously certain that those who see things differently are wrong. Haidt shows us how these intuitions differ across cultures, including the cultures of the political left and right. He blends his own research findings with those of anthropologists, historians, and other psychologists to draw a map of the moral domain. He then examines the origins of morality, overturning the view that evolution made us fundamentally selfish creatures. But rather than arguing that we are innately altruistic, he makes a more subtle claim\u2014that we are fundamentally <i>groupish. </i>It is our groupishness, he explains, that leads to our greatest joys, our religious divisions, and our political affiliations.

Through an analysis of Americans' voting behavior and opinions on a range of economic issues, he makes the convincing case that noneconomists suffer from four prevailing biases: they underestimate the wisdom of the market mechanism, distrust foreigners, undervalue the benefits of conserving labor, and pessimistically believe the economy is going from bad to worse. Caplan lays out several bold ways to make democratic government work better--for example, urging economic educators to focus on correcting popular misconceptions and recommending that democracies do less and let markets take up the slack.<br /><br /><i>The Myth of the Rational Voter</i> takes an unflinching look at how people who vote under the influence of false beliefs ultimately end up with government that delivers lousy results.

She was a poor Southern tobacco farmer who worked the same land as her slave ancestors, yet her cells\u2014taken without her knowledge\u2014became one of the most important tools in medicine. The first \u201cimmortal\u201d human cells grown in culture, they are still alive today, though she has been dead for more than sixty years. If you could pile all HeLa cells ever grown onto a scale, they\u2019d weigh more than 50 million metric tons\u2014as much as a hundred Empire State Buildings. HeLa cells were vital for developing the polio vaccine; uncovered secrets of cancer, viruses, and the atom bomb\u2019s effects; helped lead to important advances like in vitro fertilization, cloning, and gene mapping; and have been bought and sold by the billions.<p>Yet Henrietta Lacks remains virtually unknown, buried in an unmarked grave.</p><p>Now Rebecca Skloot takes us on an extraordinary journey, from the \u201ccolored\u201d ward of Johns Hopkins Hospital in the 1950s to stark white laboratories with freezers full of HeLa cells; from Henrietta\u2019s small, dying hometown of Clover, Virginia \u2014 a land of wooden slave quarters, faith healings, and voodoo \u2014 to East Baltimore today, where her children and grandchildren live and struggle with the legacy of her cells.</p><p>Henrietta\u2019s family did not learn of her \u201cimmortality\u201d until more than twenty years after her death, when scientists investigating HeLa began using her husband and children in research without informed consent.

As Rebecca Skloot so brilliantly shows, the story of the Lacks family \u2014 past and present \u2014 is inextricably connected to the dark history of experimentation on African Americans, the birth of bioethics, and the legal battles over whether we control the stuff we are made of.</p><p>Over the decade it took to uncover this story, Rebecca became enmeshed in the lives of the Lacks family\u2014especially Henrietta\u2019s daughter Deborah, who was devastated to learn about her mother\u2019s cells. She was consumed with questions: Had scientists cloned her mother? Did it hurt her when researchers infected her cells with viruses and shot them into space?

From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br /><br />Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br /><br />Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don't do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br />And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br /><br /> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br /><br />Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br /><br />Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br /><br />Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br /><br />Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br /><br />Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br /><br />And much more.

For Mitnick, hacking wasn't just about technological feats; it was an old-fashioned confidence game that required guile and deception to trick the unwitting out of valuable information.<br /><br />Driven by a powerful urge to accomplish the impossible, Mitnick bypassed security systems and blazed into major organizations including Motorola, Sun Microsystems, and Pacific Bell. As the FBI's net began to tighten, Mitnick went on the run, engaging in an increasingly sophisticated cat-and-mouse game that led through false identities, a host of cities, plenty of close shaves, and an ultimate showdown with the Feds, who would stop at nothing to bring him down. <br /><br /><i>Ghost in the Wires</i> is a thrilling true story of intrigue, suspense, and unbelievable escape, and a portrait of a visionary whose creativity, skills, and persistence forced the authorities to rethink the way they pursued him, inspiring ripples that brought permanent changes in the way people and companies protect their most sensitive information.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1344265017l/10256723.jpg"}], "Authors": "Kevin D.

In The Origin of Wealth, Eric D. Beinhocker argues that modern science provides a radical perspective on these age-old questions, with far-reaching implications. According to Beinhocker, wealth creation is the product of a simple but profoundly powerful evolutionary formula: differentiate, select, and amplify. In this view, the economy is a \"complex adaptive system\" in which physical technologies, social technologies, and business designs continuously interact to create novel products, new ideas, and increasing wealth. Taking readers on an entertaining journey through economic history, from the Stone Age to modern economy, Beinhocker explores how \"complexity economics\" provides provocative insights on issues ranging from creating adaptive organizations to the evolutionary workings of stock markets to new perspectives on government policies.

The problem with this version of history? There\u2019s not a shred of evidence to support it.<br /><br />Here anthropologist David Graeber presents a stunning reversal of conventional wisdom. He shows that for more than 5,000 years, since the beginnings of the first agrarian empires, humans have used elaborate credit systems to buy and sell goods\u2014that is, long before the invention of coins or cash. It is in this era, Graeber argues, that we also first encounter a society divided into debtors and creditors. <br /><br /> Graeber shows that arguments about debt and debt forgiveness have been at the center of political debates from Italy to China, as well as sparking innumerable insurrections. He also brilliantly demonstrates that the language of the ancient works of law and religion\u00a0(words like \u201cguilt,\u201d \u201csin,\u201d and \u201credemption\u201d) derive in large part from ancient debates about debt, and shape even our most basic ideas of right and wrong.

Questions about the long-term evolution of inequality, the concentration of wealth, and the prospects for economic growth lie at the heart of political economy. But satisfactory answers have been hard to find for lack of adequate data and clear guiding theories. In Capital in the Twenty-First Century, \"Thomas Piketty analyzes a unique collection of data from twenty countries, ranging as far back as the eighteenth century, to uncover key economic and social patterns. His findings will transform debate and set the agenda for the next generation of thought about wealth and inequality.<br /><br />Piketty shows that modern economic growth and the diffusion of knowledge have allowed us to avoid inequalities on the apocalyptic scale predicted by Karl Marx. But we have not modified the deep structures of capital and inequality as much as we thought in the optimistic decades following World War II. The main driver of inequality--the tendency of returns on capital to exceed the rate of economic growth--today threatens to generate extreme inequalities that stir discontent and undermine democratic values. But economic trends are not acts of God. Political action has curbed dangerous inequalities in the past, Piketty says, and may do so again.<br /><br />A work of extraordinary ambition, originality, and rigor, Capital in the Twenty-First Century \"reorients our understanding of economic history and confronts us with sobering lessons for today.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Thomas Piketty, Arthur Goldhammer", "Category": "Economics", "Rating": "4.04", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18736925-capital-in-the-twenty-first-century", "Pages": "685", "Year": "2014", "Rating_Dist": "5:6989|4:6952|3:3039|2:834|1:521|total:18335", "Ratings_Count": "15650", "Text_Reviews_Count": "1398"}, {"Name": "23 Things They Don't Tell You about Capitalism", "Description": "<div><br />Thing 1: There is no such thing as free market. <br />Thing 4: The washing machine has changed the world more than the Internet. <br />Thing 5: Assume the worst about people, and you get the worst. <br />Thing 13: Making rich people richer doesn't make the rest of us richer.</div><br /><div>If you've wondered how we did not see the economic collapse coming, Ha-Joon Chang knows the answer: We didn't ask what they didn't tell us about capitalism.

Most predictions fail, often at great cost to society, because most of us have a poor understanding of probability and uncertainty. Both experts and laypeople mistake more confident predictions for more accurate ones. But overconfidence is often the reason for failure. If our appreciation of uncertainty improves, our predictions can get better too. This is the \u201cprediction paradox\u201d: The more humility we have about our ability to make predictions, the more successful we can be in planning for the future.<br /><br />In keeping with his own aim to seek truth from data, Silver visits the most successful forecasters in a range of areas, from hurricanes to baseball, from the poker table to the stock market, from Capitol Hill to the NBA. He explains and evaluates how these forecasters think and what bonds they share. What lies behind their success? Are they good\u2014or just lucky? What patterns have they unraveled? And are their forecasts really right? He explores unanticipated commonalities and exposes unexpected juxtapositions. And sometimes, it is not so much how good a prediction is in an absolute sense that matters but how good it is relative to the competition. In other cases, prediction is still a very rudimentary\u2014and dangerous\u2014science.<br /><br />Silver observes that the most accurate forecasters tend to have a superior command of probability, and they tend to be both humble and hardworking. They distinguish the predictable from the unpredictable, and they notice a thousand little details that lead them closer to the truth. Because of their appreciation of probability, they can distinguish the signal from the noise.<br /><br />With everything from the health of the global economy to our ability to fight terrorism dependent on the quality of our predictions, Nate Silver\u2019s insights are an essential read.", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1355058876l/13588394.jpg"}], "Authors": "Nate Silver", "Category": "Economics", "Rating": "3.98", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/13588394-the-signal-and-the-noise", "Pages": null, "Year": null, "Rating_Dist": "5:11325|4:15628|3:7498|2:1585|1:484|total:36520", "Ratings_Count": "31656", "Text_Reviews_Count": "2428"}, {"Name": "Currency Wars: The Making of the Next Global Crisis", "Description": "In 1971, President Nixon imposed national price controls and took the United States off the gold standard, an extreme measure intended to end an ongoing currency war that had destroyed faith in the U.S. dollar. Today we are engaged in a new currency war, and this time the consequences will be far worse than those that confronted Nixon.Currency wars are one of the most destructive and feared outcomes in international economics. At best, they offer the sorry spectacle of countries' stealing growth from their trading partners. At worst, they degenerate into sequential bouts of inflation, recession, retaliation, and sometimes actual violence. Left unchecked, the next currency war could lead to a crisis worse than the panic of 2008.<br /><br />Currency wars have happened before-twice in the last century alone-and they always end badly. Time and again, paper currencies have collapsed, assets have been frozen, gold has been confiscated, and capital controls have been imposed. And the next crash is overdue. Recent headlines about the debasement of the dollar, bailouts in Greece and Ireland, and Chinese currency manipulation are all indicators of the growing conflict.<br /><br />As James Rickards argues in <i>Currency Wars</i>, this is more than just a concern for economists and investors. The United States is facing serious threats to its national security, from clandestine gold purchases by China to the hidden agendas of sovereign wealth funds. Greater than any single threat is the very real danger of the collapse of the dollar itself.<br /><br />Baffling to many observers is the rank failure of economists to foresee or prevent the economic catastrophes of recent years. Not only have their theories failed to prevent calamity, they are making the currency wars worse. The U. S. Federal Reserve has engaged in the greatest gamble in the history of finance, a sustained effort to stimulate the economy by printing money on a trillion-dollar scale. Its solutions present hidden new dangers while resolving none of the current dilemmas.<br /><br />While the outcome of the new currency war is not yet certain, some version of the worst-case scenario is almost inevitable if U.S. and world economic leaders fail to learn from the mistakes of their predecessors.

A struggle rages within each of these nations between reformers and corrupt leaders--and the corrupt are winning. Collier analyzes the causes of failure, pointing to a set of traps that ensnare these countries, including civil war, a dependence on the extraction and export of natural resources, and bad governance. Standard solutions do not work, he writes; aid is often ineffective, and globalization can actually make matters worse, driving development to more stable nations. What the bottom billion need, Collier argues, is a bold new plan supported by the Group of Eight industrialized nations. If failed states are ever to be helped, the G8 will have to adopt preferential trade policies, new laws against corruption, new international charters, and even conduct carefully calibrated military interventions.

Why did the Industrial Revolution--and the unprecedented economic growth that came with it--occur in eighteenth-century England, and not at some other time, or in some other place? Why didn't industrialization make the whole world rich--and why did it make large parts of the world even poorer? In \"A Farewell to Alms,\" Gregory Clark tackles these profound questions and suggests a new and provocative way in which culture--not exploitation, geography, or resources--explains the wealth, and the poverty, of nations.<br /> Countering the prevailing theory that the Industrial Revolution was sparked by the sudden development of stable political, legal, and economic institutions in seventeenth-century Europe, Clark shows that such institutions existed long before industrialization. He argues instead that these institutions gradually led to deep cultural changes by encouraging people to abandon hunter-gatherer instincts-violence, impatience, and economy of effort-and adopt economic habits-hard work, rationality, and education.<br /> The problem, Clark says, is that only societies that have long histories of settlement and security seem to develop the cultural characteristics and effective workforces that enable economic growth. For the many societies that have not enjoyed long periods of stability, industrialization has not been a blessing. Clark also dissects the notion, championed by Jared Diamond in \"Guns, Germs, and Steel,\" that natural endowments such as geography account for differences in the wealth of nations.<br /> A brilliant and sobering challenge to the idea that poor societies can be economically developed through outside intervention, \"A Farewell to Alms\" may change the way global economic history is understood.<br />", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Gregory Clark", "Category": "Economics", "Rating": "3.71", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/150437.A_Farewell_to_Alms", "Pages": "420", "Year": "2007", "Rating_Dist": "5:219|4:341|3:242|2:76|1:31|total:909", "Ratings_Count": "806", "Text_Reviews_Count": "93"}, {"Name": "Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind", "Description": "100,000 years ago, at least six human species inhabited the earth.

It is not, he reveals, differences of race or culture, or even the strivings of great individuals, that explain Western dominance. It is the effects of geography on the everyday efforts of ordinary people as they deal with crises of resources, disease, migration, and climate. As geography and human ingenuity continue to interact, the world will change in astonishing ways, transforming Western rule in the process.<br /><br />Deeply researched and brilliantly argued, <i>Why the West Rules\u2014for Now </i>spans fifty thousand years of history and offers fresh insights on nearly every page. The book brings together the latest findings across disciplines\u2014from ancient history to neuroscience\u2014not only to explain why the West came to rule the world but also to predict what the future will bring in the next hundred years.<br /><br /><br />", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1363862405l/9491855.jpg"}], "Authors": "Ian Morris", "Category": "History", "Rating": "4.10", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/9491855-why-the-west-rules-for-now", "Pages": "768", "Year": "2010", "Rating_Dist": "5:1534|4:1437|3:650|2:172|1:51|total:3844", "Ratings_Count": "3028", "Text_Reviews_Count": "252"}, {"Name": "The Nazi Doctors: Medical Killing and the Psychology of Genocide", "Description": "Nazi doctors did more than conduct bizarre experiments on concentration-camp inmates; they supervised the entire process of medical mass murder, from selecting those who were to be exterminated to disposing of corpses.

But while he has been widely extolled for his achievements, parts of Churchill's record have gone woefully unexamined. As journalist Madhusree Mukerjee reveals, at the same time that Churchill brilliantly opposed the barbarism of the Nazis, he governed India with a fierce resolve to crush its freedom movement and a profound contempt for native lives. A series of Churchill's decisions between 1940 and 1944 directly and inevitably led to the deaths of some three million Indians. The streets of eastern Indian cities were lined with corpses, yet instead of sending emergency food shipments Churchill used the wheat and ships at his disposal to build stockpiles for feeding postwar Britain and Europe.Combining meticulous research with a vivid narrative, and riveting accounts of personality and policy clashes within and without the British War Cabinet, <i>Churchill's Secret War </i>places this oft-overlooked tragedy into the larger context of World War II, India's fight for freedom, and Churchill's enduring legacy.

Kaplan, the bestselling author of <i>Monsoon</i> and <i>Balkan Ghosts,</i> offers a revelatory new prism through which to view global upheavals and to understand what lies ahead for continents and countries around the world.</b><br /> \u00a0<br /> In <i>The Revenge of Geography, </i>Kaplan builds on the insights, discoveries, and theories of great geographers and geopolitical thinkers of the near and distant past to look back at critical pivots in history and then to look forward at the evolving global scene. Kaplan traces the history of the world\u2019s hot spots by examining their climates, topographies, and proximities to other embattled lands. The Russian steppe\u2019s pitiless climate and limited vegetation bred hard and cruel men bent on destruction, for example, while Nazi geopoliticians distorted geopolitics entirely, calculating that space on the globe used by the British Empire and the Soviet Union could be swallowed by a greater German homeland.<br /> \u00a0<br /> Kaplan then applies the lessons learned to the present crises in Europe, Russia, China, the Indian subcontinent, Turkey, Iran, and the Arab Middle East. The result is a holistic interpretation of the next cycle of conflict throughout Eurasia. Remarkably, the future can be understood in the context of temperature, land allotment, and other physical certainties: China, able to feed only 23 percent of its people from land that is only 7 percent arable, has sought energy, minerals, and metals from such brutal regimes as Burma, Iran, and Zimbabwe, putting it in moral conflict with the United States. Afghanistan\u2019s porous borders will keep it the principal invasion route into India, and a vital rear base for Pakistan, India\u2019s main enemy. Iran will exploit the advantage of being the only country that straddles both energy-producing areas of the Persian Gulf and the Caspian Sea. Finally, Kaplan posits that the United States might rue engaging in far-flung conflicts with Iraq and Afghanistan rather than tending to its direct neighbor Mexico, which is on the verge of becoming a semifailed state due to drug cartel carnage.<br /> \u00a0<br /> A brilliant rebuttal to thinkers who suggest that globalism will trump geography, this indispensable work shows how timeless truths and natural facts can help prevent this century\u2019s looming cataclysms.<br /><br /><b>Praise for <i>The Revenge of Geography</i></b><br /><b>\u00a0</b><br />\u201c[An] ambitious and challenging new book . . .

The attacks on the World Trade Center on 9/11 and the Iraq war?

The World Is Flat is the timely and essential update on globalization, its successes and discontents, powerfully illuminated by one of our most respected journalists. <br /><br />An expanded and revised version was published in hardcover in April 2006.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Thomas L.

The novel's vision of Soviet life in the 1930s is so ferociously accurate that it could not be published during its author's lifetime and appeared only in a censored edition in the 1960s. Its truths are so enduring that its language has become part of the common Russian speech.<br /><br />One hot spring, the devil arrives in Moscow, accompanied by a retinue that includes a beautiful naked witch and an immense talking black cat with a fondness for chess and vodka. The visitors quickly wreak havoc in a city that refuses to believe in either God or Satan. But they also bring peace to two unhappy Muscovites: one is the Master, a writer pilloried for daring to write a novel about Christ and Pontius Pilate; the other is Margarita, who loves the Master so deeply that she is willing literally to go to hell for him.

The essays were written during a difficult time in Twain's life; he was deep in debt and had lost his wife and one of his daughters. The book consists of a series of short stories, many of which deal with God and Christianity. Twain penned a series of letters from the point-of-view of a dejected angel on Earth. This title story consists of letters written by the archangel Satan to archangels, Gabriel and Michael, about his observations on the curious proceedings of earthly life and the nature of man's religions. By analyzing the idea of heaven and God that is widely accepted by those who believe in both, Twain is able to take the silliness that is present and study it with the common sense that is absent.

His advanced leadership transformed the San Francisco 49ers from the worst franchise in sports to a legendary dynasty that won three Super Bowls. In the process, he changed the way football is played-pushing it into the twenty-first century.<br /><br /> Walsh is famous for his strategic brilliance and innovations, such as the West Coast Offense, but his enlightened philosophy of leadership was just as crucial, if not more so, to the unprecedented success of his teams. And that philosophy of leadership is just as powerful and productive in business or any other endeavor as it was for him on the football field. <br /><br /> Prior to his death, Walsh granted exclusive interviews to bestselling author Steve Jamison. They became his ultimate lecture on leadership-illustrated by dramatic and apt anecdotes from throughout Walsh's career. A small sample of what you'll learn from one of America's greatest coaches: <br /><br /> *\tBelieve in People: Push them hard to be their very best. No one will ever come back later and thank you for expecting too little of them.<br /> *\tProfessionalism Matters: There was no showboating allowed after touchdowns, no taunting of opponents, no demonstration to attract attention to oneself: \"Champions act like champions before they're champions.\"<br /> *\tKeep a Short Enemies List: One enemy can do more damage than the good done by a hundred friends.<br /> *\tProtect Your Blind Side: Prompt yourself to aggressively analyze not only your organization's strengths, but also its unseen vulnerabilities. <br /> *\tSometimes You Can't Have he Last Word. A leader cannot escape harsh criticism. Ignore the undeserving; learn from the deserving. Lick your wounds and move on. Your bruised ego will get over it. <br /><br /> Additional insights and perspective are provided by his son Craig Walsh, by legendary quarterback Joe Montana, and by other important figures who knew Bill well. <br /><br /> Bill Walsh taught that the requirements of successful leadership are the same whether you run an NFL franchise, a Fortune 500 company, or a hardware store with twelve employees.

Stressed from the demands of his job, he took a vacation trekking in Nepal because a friend had told him, \"If you get high enough in the mountains, you can't hear Steve Ballmer yelling at you anymore.\"<br /><br />Instead of being the antidote to the rat race, that trip convinced John Wood to divert the boundless energy he was devoting to Microsoft into a cause that desperately needed to be addressed. While visiting a remote Nepalese school, Wood learned that the students had few books in their library. When he offered to run a book drive to provide the school with books, his idea was met with polite skepticism. After all, no matter how well-intentioned, why would a successful software executive take valuable time out of his life and gather books for an impoverished school?<br /><br />But John Wood did return to that school and with thousands of books bundled on the back of a yak.

From the airline business (Virgin Atlantic Airways), to music (Virgin Records and V2), to cola (Virgin Cola), to retail (Virgin Megastores), and nearly a hundred others, ranging from financial services to bridal wear, Branson has a track record second to none.<br /><br />Losing My Virginity is the unusual, frequently outrageous autobiography of one of the great business geniuses of our time. When Richard Branson started his first business, he and his friends decided that \"since we're complete virgins at business, let's call it just that: Virgin.\" Since then, Branson has written his own \"rules\" for success, creating a group of companies with a global presence, but no central headquarters, no management hierarchy, and minimal bureaucracy.<br /><br />Many of Richard Branson's companies--airlines, retailing, and cola are good examples--were started in the face of entrenched competition. The experts said, \"Don't do it.\" But Branson found golden opportunities in markets in which customers have been ripped off or underserved, where confusion reigns, and the competition is complacent. <br />And in this stressed-out, overworked age, Richard Branson gives us a new model: a dynamic, hardworking, successful entrepreneur who lives life to the fullest. Family, friends, fun, and adventure are equally important as business in Branson's life. Losing My Virginity is a portrait of a productive, sane, balanced life, filled with rich and colorful stories:<br /><br /> Crash-landing his hot-air balloon in the Algerian desert, yet remaining determined to have another go at being the first to circle the globe<br /><br />Signing the Sex Pistols, Janet Jackson, the Rolling Stones, Boy George, and Phil Collins<br /><br />Fighting back when British Airways took on Virgin Atlantic and successfully suing this pillar of the British business establishment<br /><br />Swimming two miles to safety during a violent storm off the coast of Mexico<br /><br />Selling Virgin Records to save Virgin Atlantic<br /><br />Staging a rescue flight into Baghdad before the start of the Gulf War . . .<br /><br />And much more.

What do schoolteachers and sumo wrestlers have in common? Why do drug dealers still live with their moms? How much do parents really matter? What kind of impact did Roe v. Wade have on violent crime? Freakonomics will literally redefine the way we view the modern world.<br /><br />These may not sound like typical questions for an economist to ask. But Steven D. Levitt is not a typical economist. He is a much heralded scholar who studies the stuff and riddles of everyday life -- from cheating and crime to sports and child rearing -- and whose conclusions regularly turn the conventional wisdom on its head. He usually begins with a mountain of data and a simple, unasked question. Some of these questions concern life-and-death issues; others have an admittedly freakish quality. Thus the new field of study contained in this book: freakonomics.<br /><br />Through forceful storytelling and wry insight, Levitt and co-author Stephen J. Dubner show that economics is, at root, the study of incentives -- how people get what they want, or need, especially when other people want or need the same thing. In Freakonomics, they set out to explore the hidden side of ... well, everything. The inner workings of a crack gang. The truth about real-estate agents. The myths of campaign finance. The telltale marks of a cheating schoolteacher. The secrets of the Ku Klux Klan.<br /><br />What unites all these stories is a belief that the modern world, despite a surfeit of obfuscation, complication, and downright deceit, is not impenetrable, is not unknowable, and -- if the right questions are asked -- is even more intriguing than we think. All it takes is a new way of looking. Steven Levitt, through devilishly clever and clear-eyed thinking, shows how to see through all the clutter.<br /><br />Freakonomics establishes this unconventional premise: If morality represents how we would like the world to work, then economics represents how it actually does work. It is true that readers of this book will be armed with enough riddles and stories to last a thousand cocktail parties. But Freakonomics can provide more than that.

For Nassim Nicholas Taleb, black swans underlie almost everything about our world, from the rise of religions to events in our own personal lives.<br /><br />Why do we not acknowledge the phenomenon of black swans until after they occur? Part of the answer, according to Taleb, is that humans are hardwired to learn specifics when they should be focused on generalities. <br /><br />We concentrate on things we already know and time and time again fail to take into consideration what we don\u2019t know. We are, therefore, unable to truly estimate opportunities, too vulnerable to the impulse to simplify, narrate, and categorize, and not open enough to rewarding those who can imagine the \u201cimpossible.\u201d<br /><br />For years, Taleb has studied how we fool ourselves into thinking we know more than we actually do.

By 1993, the computer industry had changed so rapidly the company was on its way to losing $16 billion and IBM was on a watch list for extinction -- victimized by its own lumbering size, an insular corporate culture, and the PC era IBM had itself helped invent.<br /><br />Then Lou Gerstner was brought in to run IBM. Almost everyone watching the rapid demise of this American icon presumed Gerstner had joined IBM to preside over its continued dissolution into a confederation of autonomous business units. This strategy, well underway when he arrived, would have effectively eliminated the corporation that had invented many of the industry's most important technologies.<br /><br />Instead, Gerstner took hold of the company and demanded the managers work together to re-establish IBM's mission as a customer-focused provider of computing solutions. Moving ahead of his critics, Gerstner made the hold decision to keep the company together, slash prices on his core product to keep the company competitive, and almost defiantly announced, \"The last thing IBM needs right now is a vision.\"<br /><br /><em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> tells the story of IBM's competitive and cultural transformation. In his own words, Gerstner offers a blow-by-blow account of his arrival at the company and his campaign to rebuild the leadership team and give the workforce a renewed sense of purpose. In the process, Gerstner defined a strategy for the computing giant and remade the ossified culture bred by the company's own success.<br /><br />The first-hand story of an extraordinary turnaround, a unique case study in managing a crisis, and a thoughtful reflection on the computer industry and the principles of leadership, <em>Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?</em> sums up Lou Gerstner's historic business achievement. Taking readers deep into the world of IBM's CEO, Gerstner recounts the high-level meetings and explains the pressure-filled, no-turning-back decisions that had to be made. He also offers his hard-won conclusions about the essence of what makes a great company run.<br /><br />In the history of modern business, many companies have gone from being industry leaders to the verge of extinction. Through the heroic efforts of a new management team, some of those companies have even succeeded in resuscitating themselves and living on in the shadow of their former stature. But only one company has been at the pinnacle of an industry, fallen to near collapse, and then, beyond anyone's expectations, returned to set the agenda. That company is IBM.<br /><br />Lou Gerstener, Jr., served as chairman and chief executive officer of IBM from April 1993 to March 2002, when he retired as CEO. He remained chairman of the board through the end of 2002. Before joining IBM, Mr. Gerstner served for four years as chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco, Inc. This was preceded by an eleven-year career at the American Express Company, where he was president of the parent company and chairman and CEO of its largest subsidiary. Prior to that, Mr. Gerstner was a director of the management consulting firm of McKinsey &amp; Co., Inc.

In the spirit of Alvin Tofflers Future Shock, a social critique of our obsession with choice, and how it contributes to anxiety, dissatisfaction and regret. Whether we're buying a pair of jeans, ordering a cup of coffee, selecting a long-distance carrier, applying to college, choosing a doctor, or setting up a 401K, everyday decisions have become increasingly complex due to the overwhelming abundance of choice with which we are presented. In The Paradox of Choice, Barry Schwartz explains why too much of a good thing has proven detrimental to our psychological and emotional well-being. In accessible, engaging, and anecdotal prose, Schwartz explains how a culture that thrives on the availability of constantly evolving options can also foster profound dissatisfaction and self-blame in individuals, which can lead to a paralysis in decision making and, in some cases, depression. With the latest studies on how we make choices in our personal and professional lives, Schwartz offers practical advice on how to focus on the right choices, and how to derive greater satisfaction from choices that we do make.

Today, tech has finally caught up with human potential. In <i>Cognitive Surplus</i>, Internet guru Clay Shirky forecasts the thrilling changes we will all enjoy as new digital technology puts our untapped resources of talent and goodwill to use at last.<br /><br /> Since we Americans were suburbanized and educated by the postwar boom, we've had a surfeit of intellect, energy, and time-what Shirky calls a cognitive surplus. But this abundance had little impact on the common good because television consumed the lion's share of it-and we consume TV passively, in isolation from one another. Now, for the first time, people are embracing new media that allow us to pool our efforts at vanishingly low cost. The results of this aggregated effort range from mind expanding-reference tools like Wikipedia-to lifesaving-such as Ushahidi.com, which has allowed Kenyans to sidestep government censorship and report on acts of violence in real time.<br /><br /> Shirky argues persuasively that this cognitive surplus-rather than being some strange new departure from normal behavior-actually returns our society to forms of collaboration that were natural to us up through the early twentieth century. He also charts the vast effects that our cognitive surplus- aided by new technologies-will have on twenty-first-century society, and how we can best exploit those effects. Shirky envisions an era of lower creative quality on average but greater innovation, an increase in transparency in all areas of society, and a dramatic rise in productivity that will transform our civilization.<br /><br /> The potential impact of cognitive surplus is enormous. As Shirky points out, Wikipedia was built out of roughly 1 percent of the man-hours that Americans spend watching TV every year. Wikipedia and other current products of cognitive surplus are only the iceberg's tip. Shirky shows how society and our daily lives will be improved dramatically as we learn to exploit our goodwill and free time like never before.<br /><br />", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Clay Shirky", "Category": "Startups and Business", "Rating": "3.80", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7614793-cognitive-surplus", "Pages": "242", "Year": "2010", "Rating_Dist": "5:1468|4:1844|3:1303|2:327|1:170|total:5112", "Ratings_Count": "4691", "Text_Reviews_Count": "297"}, {"Name": "Zero to One: Notes on Startups, or How to Build the Future", "Description": "<strong>Comment construire le futur pour l\u2019homme qui a cr\u00e9\u00e9 PayPal et investi dans Facebook, SpaceX et Linkedin.</strong><br />-\u00ab\u00a0Ce livre propose des id\u00e9es compl\u00e8tement nouvelles et apporte une v\u00e9ritable bouff\u00e9e d\u2019air frais sur une question vitale\u00a0: comment cr\u00e9er de la valeur en ce monde.\u00a0\u00bb <em>\n  <strong>Mark Zuckerberg</strong>\n</em>, PDG de Facebook<br />- \u00ab\u00a0Peter Thiel a cr\u00e9\u00e9 plusieurs entreprises r\u00e9volutionnaires et dans <em>Z\u00e9ro \u00e0 Un</em>, il nous explique comment il s\u2019y est pris.\u00a0\u00bb <strong>Elon Musk</strong>, PDG de SpaceX et Tesla<br />- \u00ab\u00a0Quand un sp\u00e9cialiste de la prise de risque \u00e9crit un livre, lisez-le.

Drawing on recent discoveries in cognitive psychology and other disciplines, the authors offer concrete techniques for becoming more productive learners.<br /><br />Memory plays a central role in our ability to carry out complex cognitive tasks, such as applying knowledge to problems never before encountered and drawing inferences from facts already known. New insights into how memory is encoded, consolidated, and later retrieved have led to a better understanding of how we learn. Grappling with the impediments that make learning challenging leads both to more complex mastery and better retention of what was learned.<br /><br />Many common study habits and practice routines turn out to be counterproductive. Underlining and highlighting, rereading, cramming, and single-minded repetition of new skills create the illusion of mastery, but gains fade quickly. More complex and durable learning come from self-testing, introducing certain difficulties in practice, waiting to re-study new material until a little forgetting has set in, and interleaving the practice of one skill or topic with another.

A public figure since winning his first National Chess Championship at the age of nine, Waitzkin was catapulted into a media whirlwind as a teenager when his father's book \"Searching for Bobby Fischer\" was made into a major motion picture. After dominating the scholastic chess world for ten years, Waitzkin expanded his horizons, taking on the martial art Tai Chi Chuan and ultimately earning the title of World Champion. How was he able to reach the pinnacle of two disciplines that on the surface seem so different? \"I've come to realize that what I am best at is not Tai Chi, and it is not chess,\" he says. \"What I am best at is the art of learning.\"In his riveting new book, \"The Art of Learning,\" Waitzkin tells his remarkable story of personal achievement and shares the principles of learning and performance that have propelled him to the top -- twice.<br /><br />With a narrative that combines heart-stopping martial arts wars and tense chess face-offs with life lessons that speak to all of us, \"The Art of Learning\" takes readers through Waitzkin's unique journey to excellence. He explains in clear detail how a well-thought-out, principled approach to learning is what separates success from failure. Waitzkin believes that achievement, even at the championship level, is a function of a lifestyle that fuels a creative, resilient growth process. Rather than focusing on climactic wins, Waitzkin reveals the inner workings of his everyday method, from systematically triggering intuitive breakthroughs, to honing techniques into states of remarkable potency, to mastering the art of performance psychology.<br /><br />Through his own example, Waitzkin explains how to embrace defeat and make mistakes work for you. Does your opponent make you angry? Waitzkin describes how to channel emotions into creative fuel. As he explains it, obstacles are not obstacles but challenges to overcome, to spur the growth process by turning weaknesses into strengths. He illustrates the exact routines that he has used in all of his competitions, whether mental or physical, so that you too can achieve your peak performance zone in any competitive or professional circumstance.<br /><br />In stories ranging from his early years taking on chess hustlers as a seven year old in New York City's Washington Square Park, to dealing with the pressures of having a film made about his life, to International Chess Championships in India, Hungary, and Brazil, to gripping battles against powerhouse fighters in Taiwan in the Push Hands World Championships, \"The Art of Learning\" encapsulates an extraordinary competitor's life lessons in a page-turning narrative.", "Image": [{"url": "https://s.gr-assets.com/assets/nophoto/book/111x148-bcc042a9c91a29c1d680899eff700a03.png"}], "Authors": "Josh Waitzkin", "Category": "Education", "Rating": "4.09", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/857333.The_Art_of_Learning", "Pages": "265", "Year": "2007", "Rating_Dist": "5:4591|4:3899|3:2093|2:547|1:145|total:11275", "Ratings_Count": "8999", "Text_Reviews_Count": "734"}, {"Name": "Wounded by School: Recapturing the Joy in Learning and Standing Up to Old School Culture", "Description": "While reformers and policymakers focus on achievement gaps, testing, and accountability, millions of students mentally and emotionally disengage from learning and many gifted teachers leave the field.

The result of genetic experimentation, Ender may be the military genius Earth desperately needs in a war against an alien enemy seeking to destroy all human life. The only way to find out is to throw Ender into ever harsher training, to chip away and find the diamond inside, or destroy him utterly. Ender Wiggin is six years old when it begins. He will grow up fast.<br /><br />But Ender is not the only result of the experiment. The war with the Buggers has been raging for a hundred years, and the quest for the perfect general has been underway almost as long. Ender's two older siblings, Peter and Valentine, are every bit as unusual as he is, but in very different ways. While Peter was too uncontrollably violent, Valentine very nearly lacks the capability for violence altogether. Neither was found suitable for the military's purpose. But they are driven by their jealousy of Ender, and by their inbred drive for power. Peter seeks to control the political process, to become a ruler. Valentine's abilities turn more toward the subtle control of the beliefs of commoner and elite alike, through powerfully convincing essays. Hiding their youth and identities behind the anonymity of the computer networks, these two begin working together to shape the destiny of Earth-an Earth that has no future at all if their brother Ender fails.<br /><br />Source: hatrack.com", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1408303130l/375802.jpg"}], "Authors": "Orson Scott Card", "Category": "Science Fiction", "Rating": "4.30", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/375802.Ender_s_Game", "Pages": "324", "Year": "1994", "Rating_Dist": "5:524773|4:297584|3:115688|2:30681|1:16917|total:985643", "Ratings_Count": "914449", "Text_Reviews_Count": "35179"}, {"Name": "Speaker for the Dead (Ender's Saga, #2)", "Description": "Now available in mass market, the revised, definitive edition of the Hugo and Nebula Award-winning classic.

Engineering professor Barbara Oakley knows firsthand how it feels to struggle with math. She flunked her way through high school math and science courses, before enlisting in the army immediately after graduation. When she saw how her lack of mathematical and technical savvy severely limited her options\u2014both to rise in the military and to explore other careers\u2014she returned to school with a newfound determination to re-tool her brain to master the very subjects that had given her so much trouble throughout her entire life.<br />\u00a0<br />In <i>A Mind for Numbers</i>, Dr. Oakley lets us in on the secrets to effectively learning math and science\u2014secrets that even dedicated and successful students wish they\u2019d known earlier. Contrary to popular belief, math requires creative, as well as analytical, thinking. Most people think that there\u2019s only one way to do a problem, when in actuality, there are often a number of different solutions\u2014you just need the creativity to see them. For example, there are more than three hundred different known proofs of the Pythagorean Theorem. In short, studying a problem in a laser-focused way until you reach a solution is not an effective way to learn math. Rather, it involves taking the time to step away from a problem and allow the more relaxed and creative part of the brain to take over. <i>A Mind for Numbers </i>shows us that we all have what it takes to excel in math, and learning it is not as painful as some might think!", "Image": [{"url": "https://images.gr-assets.com/books/1387148777l/18693655.jpg"}], "Authors": "Barbara Oakley", "Category": "Logic and Problem Solving", "Rating": "4.24", "Goodreads": "https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/18693655-a-mind-for-numbers", "Pages": "322", "Year": "2014", "Rating_Dist": "5:3784|4:2895|3:1095|2:255|1:68|total:8097", "Ratings_Count": "6685", "Text_Reviews_Count": "746"}, {"Name": "How to Solve It: A New Aspect of Mathematical Method", "Description": "A perennial bestseller by eminent mathematician G.
